# Day 5 notes

Another bytecode task, awesome! Instead of reusing [intcode.pl from day2](../2/intcode.pl),
I decided to rewrite the interpreter from scratch. I quite like how
[today's implementation](./intcode.pl) looks and runs.

---

Lines of code:

* **`intcode.pl`:**

  * 108 total - 1 `module/2` - 6 `use_module/1` = 101

* **`solution.pl`:**
  * `main/1`: 4

Total: 101 + 4 = 105
