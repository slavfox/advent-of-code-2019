# A very patient Advent of Code 2019

Doing this year in Prolog! Expect slowness.

Usually, files called `part1.pl` and `part2.pl` contain just the code that reads
a file and writes out the answer. I am calculating lines of code very liberally:
I include only `main` and any predicates defined in `partx.pl`, and the entire
line count of every day's library. For example, if `part2.pl` has 20 lines of
imports, a 3-line `main/2`, and uses predicates defined in `foo.pl` which has
10 lines other than imports and `module`, I will consider the line count to be 13.
The table here lists the line count for part 2 of each day.

Every day's `README.md` will have a detailed
explanation of how I calculated the line count of the solution.


You'll need SWI Prolog. Run each day's solution by doing
```
Welcome to fish, the friendly interactive shell
Type help for instructions on how to use fish
you@hostname ~> 1/
you@hostname ~> swipl part1.pl input.txt  # ditto for part 2, 3, etc...
```
Fish is the best shell btw.
